# AoC2016

Advent of Code 2016. There's not much more to know.

* Every day has its own folder.
* In every folder there is a:
  * main.py, which contains the code for the solution (two functions: `part1` and `part2`).
  * puzzle.md, which contains the puzzle description.
  * sample.txt, which contains the sample input.
  * input.txt, which contains the whole puzzle input.
